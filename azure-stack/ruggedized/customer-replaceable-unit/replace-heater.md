# Replacing the Heater

Read the following sections before you remove the old heater and install the new heater. 

## Unpacking and taking inventory of the heater 

The Ruggedized 1U Heater â€“ V2 (the heater) typically ships as a pre-installed sub-component of the Ruggedized Cloud Appliance system. When shipped separately, the heater is shipped in a standard commercial shipping carton with protective packing material. 

Carefully remove the heater from the shipping carton. When packed in a shipping carton, the heater has all key components installed in the chassis. The heater is usually part of a transit case and integrated with an entire group of devices in a transit case. Keep the shipping carton and packing materials for any possible need to re-ship the heater in the future. While the heater is robust, ensure that the unit is properly packed for shipment. 

Do an inventory check to ensure that everything is accounted for. For discrepancies, contact Microsoft. 

## Heater installation planning 

Before you begin your installation, ensure that you are familiar with the configuration requirements of the heater unit. Before you begin the installation: 

1. Prepare the transit case for heater installation. 

2. Verify that you have all necessary screws and washers for the heater installation: 

    * Four black screws 10-32 x 7/8 with four split washers and four flat washers 
    
    * Four silver 10-32 x 5/8 screws with four split washers and four flat washers 
    
3. Ensure that cables or cords are not in the way of installation. 

## Heater installation notes 

The heater is mounted into a transit case capable of holding the unit. 

* Remove the lids of the transit case and any shipping covers while the heater is in use. 

* Ensure that there is a minimum gap of six inches in the front and rear of the heater to maintain the correct airflow around the unit. 

* Mount the heater into the rack in the transit case. 

* Mount the heater into the 19-inch rack in the transit case. Use two or more individuals to manage the weight of the unit during the mounting process. 

* Install any other required component such as plenums, cables, or brackets. 

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that the socket outlet is installed near the equipment and is easily accessible.

## Removing the heater

1. Starting with the front pod cover, turn the eight cover latches counterclockwise to release the cover from the pod. Hold or secure the cover as you release all eight latches.

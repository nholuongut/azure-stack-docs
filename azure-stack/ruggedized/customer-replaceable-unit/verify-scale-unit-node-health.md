# Verifying scale unit node health

1.  In the **Administration Portal**, verify the **Cores** and
    **Memory** columns are populated for the node as expected.
    
    If you see dashes, continue to wait
    until the correct numbers are displayed. If an hour passes and the
    dashes still remain, please contact Microsoft Support for
    assistance.
    
2.  In **Region Management**, under the **General** tab, select **Alerts** and confirm there are no
    new alerts.

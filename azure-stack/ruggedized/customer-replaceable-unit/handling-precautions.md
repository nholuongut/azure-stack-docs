# Handling precautions

This section describes the precautions that you must take and the
general procedures that you must follow when removing and storing any
field replaceable unit (FRU) or customer replaceable unit (CRU).

## Handling field and customer replaceable units

You should not remove a faulty FRU or CRU until you have a replacement
available.

When you replace FRUs or CRUs, you can accidentally damage the
sensitive electronic circuits in the equipment by touching
them. Electrostatic charge (ESD) that has accumulated on your body
discharges through the circuits. If the air in the work area is very
dry, run a humidifier in the work area to decrease the risk
of ESD damage. Follow the procedures below to prevent damage to the
equipment.

-   Provide enough room to work on the equipment.

-   Clear the work site of any unnecessary materials or materials that
    naturally build up electrostatic charge, such as foam packaging,
    foam cups, cellophane wrappers, and similar items.

-   Don't remove replacement FRUs or CRUs from their antistatic
    packaging until you are ready to install them.

-   Before you service a chassis, gather the ESD kit and all other
    materials you will need. Once servicing begins, avoid moving away
    from the work site or you may build up an electrostatic charge.

-   Use the ESD kit, including the ESD wristband, when handling any FRU
    or CRU.

-   To use the ESD wristband (strap), attach the clip of the wristband
    to any bare (unpainted) metal on the chassis, then put the wristband
    around your wrist with the metal button against your skin.

-   If an emergency arises and the ESD kit is not available, follow the
    procedures below.

## Emergency procedures when an ESD kit is not available

In an emergency when an ESD kit is not available, use the following
procedures to reduce the possibility of an electrostatic discharge by
ensuring that your body and the subassembly are at the same
electrostatic potential.

> [!NOTE]
> These procedures are not a substitute for the use of an ESD
kit. Follow them only in the event of an emergency.

-   Before touching any unit, touch a bare (unpainted) metal surface of
    the cabinet, rack, or enclosure.

-   Before removing any unit from its antistatic bag, place one hand
    firmly on a bare metal surface of the cabinet/rack or enclosure, and
    at the same time, pick up the unit while it is still sealed in the
    antistatic bag. Once you have done this, don't move around the room
    or touch other furnishings, personnel, or surfaces until you have
    installed the unit.

-   When you remove a unit from the antistatic bag, avoid touching any
    electronic components and circuits on it.

-   If you must move around the room or touch other surfaces before
    installing a unit, first place the unit back in the antistatic bag.
    When you are ready again to install the unit, repeat these
    procedures.

# Indicators and codes

The features described in this section are the same for the Hardware Lifecycle Host and scale unit node servers.

## System information label

The following figure shows the system information label, which is on the front panel.

## iDRAC Direct LED indicator codes

The iDRAC Direct LED indicator lights up to indicate that the port is
connected and is being used as a part of the iDRAC subsystem.

You can configure the iDRAC Direct by using a USB to micro-USB (type
AB) cable, which you can connect to your laptop or tablet. The
following table describes the iDRAC Direct activity when the iDRAC
Direct port is active and explains iDRAC Direct LED indicator codes.

| Flashing green (on for two seconds and off for two seconds) | Indicates that the laptop or tablet connected is recognized. |
| Not illuminated                                             | Indicates that the laptop or tablet is unplugged.            |

## Power supply unit indicator codes

AC power supply units (PSUs) have an illuminated translucent handle
that serves as an indicator. DC PSUs have an LED that serves as an
indicator. The indicator shows whether power is present or a power
fault has occurred.

The following figure shows the AC PSU.

Figure 12. AC PSU

![A diagram that shows the AC PSU, with the LED indicated.](media/image-83.png)

The following table defines the indicator codes.

| Blinking green and turns off  | When hot-plugging a PSU, the PSU handle blinks green five times at a rate of 4 Hz and turns off. This indicates a PSU mismatch with respect to efficiency, feature set, health status, or supported voltage. <br><br>If two PSUs are installed, both the PSUs must have the same type of label; for example, Extended Power Performance (EPP) label. Mixing PSUs from previous generations of servers is not supported, even if the PSUs have the same power rating. This results in a PSU mismatch condition or failure to turn the system on. <br>When correcting a PSU mismatch, replace only the PSU with the blinking indicator. Swapping the PSU to make a matched pair can result in an error condition and <br>unexpected system shutdown. To change from a high output configuration to a low output configuration or vice versa, you must turn off the system. <br>AC PSUs support both 240 V and 120 V input voltages with the exception of Titanium PSUs, which support only 240 V. When two identical PSUs receive different input voltages, they can output different wattages, and trigger a mismatch. <br>If two PSUs are used, they must be of the same type and have the same maximum output power. <br>Combining AC and DC PSUs is not supported and triggers a mismatch. |

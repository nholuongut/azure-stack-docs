# Required knowledge for working with the Hardware Lifecycle Host

To complete FRU procedures, you must be familiar with and able to
access the following concepts and guides.

## Hardware Lifecycle Host

The Hardware Lifecycle Host (HLH) is a physical management server
located at top of the Azure Stack Hub rack. To access the host, you
can connect to it using one of three methods:

* Direct (crash cart)
* iDRAC (service port)
* iDRAC (IP access)

If inside the data center, then you can connect to the HLH directly
using the VGA and USB ports. For example, connecting a crash cart.

If inside the data center, then connect your laptop to the iDRAC 9
service port using a micro USB cable. For more information, see Accessing the iDRAC interface over a direct USB connection.

Work with the customer to connect to the HLH from their management
network and management workstation to the iDRAC IP.

> [!NOTE]
> Only networks that
were previously added to the switch ACLs can connect directly to the
HLH iDRAC.

## Credentials

Work with the customer to obtain the credentials for the following:

* HLH
* administrator
* iDRAC account (optional)

A Windows account with full administrator rights.

If not connecting directly to the server using a crash cart, then you
will need the iDRAC account credentials to gain access to the virtual
KVM.

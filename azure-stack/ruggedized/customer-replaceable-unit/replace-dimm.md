    -   Required knowledge for working with scale unit nodes in a
        Ruggedized Cloud
        Appliance if you are working with a scale unit node

    -   Required knowledge for working with the Hardware Lifecycle
        Host if you are working with the Hardware Lifecycle Host

4.  Complete

    -   Verifying scale unit node access and health if you are working with a scale unit node

    -   Verifying Hardware Lifecycle Host access and
        health if you are working with the Hardware Lifecycle Host

5.  Complete

    -   Powering off scale unit nodes if you are working with a scale unit node

    -   Powering off the Hardware Lifecycle
        Host if
        you are working with the Hardware Lifecycle Host

## Steps

1.  Locate the physical node in the rack.

2.  Verify that the node is powered off. The power LED should be orange.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Before disconnecting the cables on the server you are working on, ensure that each cable is properly labeled. The cables MUST be reconnected to the same ports.

# Intent: As an Azure/Azure Stack user, I want to start developing apps for Azure Stack using Azure services because I might not yet have access to a Stack environment.

# Develop for Azure Stack Hub

You can get started developing apps today, even if you do not have access to an Azure Stack Hub environment. Azure Stack Hub delivers Microsoft Azure services that run in your datacenter, which means you can use the same Azure tools and processes to develop on Azure Stack Hub.

## Development considerations

With some preparation, and using the guidance in the following topics, you can use Azure to emulate an Azure Stack Hub environment.

* In Azure, you can create Azure Resource Manager templates that are deployable to Azure Stack Hub. See [template considerations](azure-stack-develop-templates.md) for guidance on developing templates to ensure portability.
* There are differences in service availability and service versioning between Azure and Azure Stack Hub. You can use the [Azure Stack Hub policy module](azure-stack-policy-module.md) to restrict Azure service availability and resource types to what is available in Azure Stack Hub. Constraining services ensures that your apps rely on services available to Azure Stack Hub.
* The [Azure Stack Hub quickstart templates](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates) are common scenario examples that show how to develop templates deployable to both Azure and Azure Stack Hub.

## Next steps

Next, create or renew your TLS certificate for securing the value-add resource provider endpoints:

1. Complete the steps in [Generate certificate signing requests (CSRs) for certificate renewal](/azure-stack/operator/azure-stack-get-pki-certs?pivots=csr-type-renewal#generate-csrs-for-renewal-certificates) for your resource provider. Here you use the Azure Stack Hub Readiness Checker tool to create the CSR. Be sure to run the correct cmdlet for your resource provider, in the step "Generate certificate requests for other Azure Stack Hub services". For example `New-AzsHubEventHubsCertificateSigningRequest` is used for Event Hubs. When finished, you submit the generated .REQ file to your Certificate Authority (CA) for the new certificate.

2. Once you've received your certificate file from the CA, complete the steps in [Prepare certificates for deployment or rotation](../operator/azure-stack-prepare-pki-certs.md). You use the Readiness Checker tool again, to process the file returned from the CA.

3. Finally, complete the steps in [Validate Azure Stack Hub PKI certificates](../operator/azure-stack-validate-pki-certs.md). You use the Readiness Checker tool once more, to perform validation tests on your new certificate.

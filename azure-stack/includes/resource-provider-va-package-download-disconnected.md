For a disconnected or partially connected scenario, you download the packages to your local machine then import them into your Azure Stack Hub Marketplace:

1. Follow the instructions in [Download Marketplace items - Disconnected or partially connected scenario](../operator/azure-stack-download-azure-marketplace-item.md?pivots=state-disconnected). Here you download and run the Marketplace Syndication tool, which allows you to download resource provider packages.
2. After the syndication tool's "Azure Marketplace Items" window opens, find and select the name of the resource provider to download the required packages to your local machine.
3. Once the download finishes, you import the packages to your Azure Stack Hub instance and publish to Marketplace.

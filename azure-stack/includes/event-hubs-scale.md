> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production deployments requiring high availability (HA), we recommend a 2 CU cluster. For non-HA and development/test, you can start with 1 CU.
>
> CU scale-out (smaller-to-larger) is supported via the [Create Event Hubs Cluster blade](../user/event-hubs-quickstart-cluster-portal.md#create-an-event-hubs-cluster). Scale-in (larger-to-smaller) is not supported.

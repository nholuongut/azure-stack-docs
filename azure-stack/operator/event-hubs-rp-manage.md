# How to manage Event Hubs on Azure Stack Hub

The Event Hubs management experience allows you to control the service and visualize its status and alerts. 

## Overview

Use the following steps to access the Event Hubs management page:

1. Sign in to the Azure Stack Hub administrator portal.
2. Select **All Services** from the pane on the left.
3. Search for "Event Hubs" and select the service. If you can't find the Event Hubs service, the resource provider must first be [installed](event-hubs-rp-install.md).
4. The Event Hubs management overview page display. You'll find four sections in the left pane:
   - **Overview**: provides a general view and access to specific management areas.
   - **Alerts**: displays all critical and warning alerts for Event Hubs. See the [Alerts section](#alerts) section for details.
   - **Quotas**: allows you to create, update, and delete quotas. See the [Quotas section](#quotas) section for details.
   - **Event Hubs clusters**: displays a list of all clusters configured. See the [Event Hubs clusters](#event-hubs-clusters) section for details.

For more information on Azure Stack Hub monitoring capability, including alerting, see [Monitor Health and Alerts](azure-stack-monitor-health.md). For details on collecting logs, see [Overview of Azure Stack diagnostic log collection](./diagnostic-log-collection.md).

## Event Hubs clusters

Selecting **Event Hubs clusters** on the main page displays a list of available user clusters. The list includes the following for each cluster:

- High-level configuration information.
- Service health.
- Backup status.

[![Manage event hubs - user resources](media/event-hubs-rp-manage/4-user-resources.png)](media/event-hubs-rp-manage/4-user-resources.png#lightbox)

Selecting a link under **Health** or **Backup** will display detailed information on the state of Event Hubs health and backup status, respectively. The link under **Name** displays more details for the cluster, including:
- Status and configuration information.
- A list of service limits for the cluster.

Service limits are configuration parameters that define the operational boundaries of Event Hubs. The service limits available are similar to the ones offered for Azure Event Hubs Dedicated. By selecting the link(s) under **Config value**, you can change the assigned value.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should spend time analyzing the full implications before changing service limits. Service limit changes may impact the behavior of your solution that consumes and produces events. Changes may also impact the resource consumption from your Azure Stack capacity.

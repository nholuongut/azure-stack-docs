# Offer a network solution in Azure Stack Hub with Fortinet FortiGate

You can add FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) to your Azure Stack Hub Marketplace. FortiGate lets your users create network solutions such as a virtual private network (VPN) to Azure Stack Hub and VNET peering. A network virtual appliance (NVA) controls the flow of network traffic from a perimeter network to other networks or subnets.

## Download the required Azure Stack Hub Marketplace items

1. Open the Azure Stack Hub administrator portal.

2. Select **Marketplace management** and select **Add from Azure**.

3. Type `Forti` in the search box, and double-click > select **Download** to get the latest available versions of the following items:
    - Fortinet FortiGate-VM For Azure BYOL
    - FortiGate NGFW - Single VM Deployment (BYOL)

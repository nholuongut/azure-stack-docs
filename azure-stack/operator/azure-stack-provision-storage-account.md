# Create storage accounts in Azure Stack Hub

Storage accounts in Azure Stack Hub include Blob and Table services, and the unique namespace for your storage data objects. By default, the data in your account is available only to you, the storage account owner.

1. On the Azure Stack Hub POC computer, sign in to `https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external` as [an admin](../asdk/asdk-connect.md), and then click **+ Create a resource** > **Data + Storage** > **Storage account**.

2. In the **Create storage account** blade, type a name for your storage account. Create a new **Resource Group**, or select an existing one, then click **Create** to create the storage account.

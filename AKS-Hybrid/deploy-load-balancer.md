# Create a MetalLB load balancer using Azure Arc

[!INCLUDE [hci-applies-to-23h2](includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

The main purpose of a load balancer is to distribute traffic across multiple nodes in a Kubernetes cluster. This can help prevent downtime and improve overall performance of applications. AKS enabled by Azure Arc supports creating MetalLB load balancer instance on your Kubernetes cluster using the load balancer Arc extension.

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster with at least one Linux node. You can create a Kubernetes cluster on AKS using the [Azure CLI](aks-create-clusters-cli.md) or the Azure portal.
- Make sure you have enough IP addresses for the load balancer. Ensure that the IP addresses reserved for the load balancer do not conflict with the IP addresses in Arc VM logical networks and control plane IPs. For more information about IP address planning and networking in Kubernetes, see [Networking requirements for AKS on Azure Stack HCI 23H2](aks-hci-network-system-requirements.md).

## Deploy MetalLB load balancer using Azure Arc extension

> [!WARNING]
> IP address conflict checking is not currently supported. It's recommended that you perform this check when you create load balancers.

Once you successfully create your Kubernetes cluster, navigate to the **Networking** blade in the Azure portal and select **Install**:

After the extension is successfully installed, you can create a load balancer service. Select **Add** and fill in the load balancer name and its IP range. The **Service Selector** field is optional. Then select **OK**.

- The IP range should be set to available IPs depending on your environment. The IP range should be in CIDR notation; for example, **192.168.50.51/32** or **192.168.50.51/32,192.168.50.52/32**. Multiple IPs must be separated by commas.
- **Selector** is optional. A null value means the load balancer works for all services. **Selector** should be in a format such as **a:b,c:d**, separated by a comma. Remember to replace **=** with **:** for the **a=b** label in the Kubernetes cluster.

Once the load balancer is successfully created, it's shown in the list as follows. **Provisioning state** shows the operation result:

Go back to the Kubernetes cluster and check that the load balancer works. The load balancer automatically assigns an IP address to your load balancer type service, and then the service is reachable.

Run the `kubectl get arcnwloadbalancer -n kube-system` command to check the load balancer status in the Kubernetes cluster. If anything is wrong, you can check the logs for **arcnetworking-prefix** pods in the **kube-system** namespace.

### Clean up resources

To clean up resources, do the following:

- When one of the load balancers is no longer needed, select the start of the row for the load balancer and select **Delete**. Then select **Yes**.
- When the load balancer service is no longer needed, delete all existing load balancers and then select **Uninstall**. Select **Yes** to uninstall the extension.
